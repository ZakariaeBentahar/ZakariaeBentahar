# Hi there, I’m Zakariae 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space.

I'm **Zakariae Bentahar**, a data science engineering student at **ENSIIE** and enrolled in the **IMSD Master’s program** at **Université Paris-Saclay**.  
I’m passionate about everything related to data: understanding it, structuring it, interpreting it — but above all, **using it to make better decisions**.

My goal is clear: to apply my skills in data science and engineering to **real-world challenges**, particularly in **insurance and finance**, where data truly drives impact.

**🎯 2025 Goal: Land a full-time role in Data Science / Data Engineering in a demanding, meaningful, and impact-driven environment.**

## 🎯 My Approach

Every project here is designed as a **professional use case**, with:
- **Clear business objectives**
- **Visible progress**
- **Interpretable results**
- And documentation that speaks to both data engineers and business stakeholders.

My priority: **create value with data**, not just build models.
